This is the Python extension to the Swiss Ephemeris by AstroDienst.

The Swiss Ephemeris is the de-facto standard library for astrological
calculations. It is a high-precision ephemeris, based upon the DE431
ephemerides from NASA's JPL, and covering the time range 13201 BC to AD 17191.

Usage Example
=============

::

    >>> import swisseph as swe
    >>> # first set path to ephemeris files
    >>> swe.set_ephe_path('/usr/share/sweph/ephe')
    >>> # find time of next lunar eclipse
    >>> jd = swe.julday(2007, 3, 3) # julian day
    >>> res = swe.lun_eclipse_when(jd)
    >>> ecltime = swe.revjul(res[1][0])
    >>> print(ecltime)
    (2007, 3, 3, 23.347926892340183)
    >>> # get ecliptic position of asteroid 13681 "Monty Python"
    >>> jd = swe.julday(2008, 3, 21)
    >>> xx, rflags = swe.calc_ut(jd, swe.AST_OFFSET+13681)
    >>> # print longitude
    >>> print(xx[0])

Source code
===========
Navigate into the folder you want to clone the repository.

Clone the Github repository with command:

``git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/astrorigin/pyswisseph``

cd pyswisseph

python setup.py install

Licensing
=========

The Pyswisseph package adopts the GNU Affero General Public License version 3.
See the ``LICENSE.txt`` file.

The original swisseph library is distributed under a dual licensing system:
GNU Affero General Public License, or Swiss Ephemeris Professional License.
For more information, see file ``libswe/LICENSE``.

Test Suite
==========

For now, the tests can be run with the standard ``python3 setup.py test``
command. For them to pass successfully, you need a basic set of ephemerides
files installed somewhere on your system:

- ``seas_18.se1``
- ``sefstars.txt``
- ``semo_18.se1``
- ``sepl_18.se1``

All downloadable from https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/ephe/

The path to the directory containing those files must be indicated in the
environment variable ``SE_EPHE_PATH``.

For example, on a system with the ``env`` command, you can do::

    env SE_EPHE_PATH="/usr/share/sweph/ephe" python3 setup.py test
