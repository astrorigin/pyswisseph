  Swiss Ephemeris is made available by its authors under a dual licensing

  which are
  a) GNU public license version 2 or later
  b) Swiss Ephemeris Professional License

  The choice must be made before the software developer distributes software
  containing parts of Swiss Ephemeris to others, and before any public
  service using the developed software is activated.

  If the developer choses the GNU GPL software license, he or she must fulfill
  the conditions of that license, which includes the obligation to place his
  or her whole software project under the GNU GPL or a compatible license.
  See http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html

  If the developer choses the Swiss Ephemeris Professional license,
  he must follow the instructions as found in http://www.astro.com/swisseph/ 
  and purchase the Swiss Ephemeris Professional Edition from Astrodienst
  and sign the corresponding license contract.

  The License grants you the right to use, copy, modify and redistribute
  Swiss Ephemeris, but only under certain conditions described in the License.
  Among other things, the License requires that the copyright notices and
