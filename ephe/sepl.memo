What we must do to prepare the release of Swiss Ephemeris Free Edition:

- add copyright notice to every source file
- define published package
- publish make files for compiling 
  - the 32 bit DLL
  - the 16 bit DLL
  - a 16 bit MSDOS linkable libary
  - a 32 bit linkable library
- extend the documentation with a source description and some
  build information
